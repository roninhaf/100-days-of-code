### Day 5: January 08, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Advanced on my Portfolio challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Found how to smooth scroll from a menu button to an anchor anywhere on the page. Used JQuery and an algorithm from w3schools.com eventhough I don't fully understand it. But works fine.

### Day 6: January 09, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Tried different menus on my Portfolio challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Tried different ways for my menu, horizontal, vertical, side, using CSS, Bootstrap. W3CSS looked nice but I'm not sure I want to dig into this now and prefer to stay with regular CSS for now.
